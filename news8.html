        <h2>Sri Lanka PM says China to develop strategic infrastructure</h2>
        <p class="disc">Sri Lanka’s prime minister said on Wednesday that China has pledged to develop the island nation’s strategic deep sea port and the capital’s airport after talks with his counterpart in Beijing.</p>
        <img src="/Sri Lanka & China.jpg" alt="">
        <p><span>P</span>rime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena said China — the island’s biggest bilateral creditor — would “assist” Sri Lanka’s restructuring of external debt, a key condition to maintaining a $2.9 billion IMF bailout.
            Beijing’s position on debt restructuring has not been made public, but Sri Lankan officials have said China was reluctant to take a haircut on its loans but could extend the tenure and adjust interest rates.
            <br><br>
            Sri Lanka in 2022 ran out of foreign exchange to finance essential imports and declared a sovereign default on its $46 billion foreign debt.
            Months of protests forced then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa out of office.
            Gunawardena’s office said Premier Li Qiang had promised China would “assist Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring process continuously and help Sri Lanka to develop its economy”.
            <br><br>
            Gunawardena said Beijing had offered “assistance to develop” Colombo International Airport and Hambantota port, the statement added, without giving further details. A Japanese-funded expansion of Colombo airport had been on hold since Sri Lanka’s sovereign debt default.
            The southern sea port of Hambantota was handed to a Chinese state-owned company in 2017 on a 99-year lease for $1.12 billion, sparking security concerns in Beijing’s regional rival India.
            India and the United States are both concerned that a Chinese foothold at Hambantota, on the island’s southern coast, could boost its naval advantage in the Indian Ocean.
            Sri Lanka has insisted its ports will not be used for any military purposes, but New Delhi has objected to Chinese research vessels calling at Hambantota fearing that they could be used for espionage.</p>

            <h3>Chinese military ship docks in Sri Lanka</h3>
            <p>HAMBANTOTA: A Chinese re­­search vessel bristling with antennas and communication gear docked at Sri Lanka’s Chinese-run port of Hambantota on Tuesday despite concerns from India and the United States about its alleged spying activities.
                <br>
                The Yuan Wang 5 entered the deep-sea port after securing permission to enter Sri Lankan waters on the condition it would not engage in research, port officials said.
                It was originally due to arrive last week, but Colombo asked Beijing to defer the visit following objections by India, which shares Western concerns about Chinese activities in the region.
                But on Saturday, after intense negotiations, Sri Lanka announced a U-turn, saying permission was restored to dock at the southern port and remain for six days for refuelling and taking in other supplies.
                <br><br>
                New Delhi lodges complaint with Colombo, Washington raises security concerns
                “We are granting the same facilities that we extend to all other countries,” government spokesman Bandula Gunawardana told reporters. “All these countries are important to us.”
                Chinese ambassador to Sri Lanka Qi Zhenhong said the visit of Yuan Wang 5 was part of “normal ex­­changes between the two countries”.
                “China and Sri Lanka enjoy outstanding friendship,” Qi told reporters at a ceremony to welcome the ship.
                <br><br>
                Shipping analytics websites des­cribed the Yuan Wang 5 as a research and survey vessel, but according to Indian media it is a dual-use spy ship.
                There was no customary military band to welcome the vessel, but a small group of traditional Kandyan dancers and drummers performed on a red carpet.
                Also dockside were several lawmakers, but there were no senior politicians or other dignitaries in attendance.
                “Long live China and Sri Lanka friendship,” read a red-and-white banner on an upper deck of the vessel, which had at least four satellite dish antennas pointed skywards.
                Men in white shirts and black trousers stood on deck waving Chinese and Sri Lankan flags as the vessel was pushed alongside the main jetty.
                <br><br>
                The Hambantota port has been run by the Chinese since 2017, when they took it on a 99-year lease for $1.12 billion, less than the $1.4bn Sri Lanka paid a Chinese firm to build it.
                New Delhi is suspicious of Beijing’s increasing presence in the Indian Ocean and influence in Sri Lanka, seeing both as firmly within its sphere of influence.
                Both India and the US have raised security concerns over the ship’s visit to Sri Lanka, with New Delhi lodging a complaint with Colombo.
                China has said it was “completely unjustified for certain countries” to cite “security concerns” to pressure Sri Lanka, especially at a time when the island is facing an unprecedented economic crisis.
                <br><br>
                The vessel’s activities were “in line with international law and international practice, and do not affect any country’s security or economic interests,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters. “They should not be interfered with by third parties.”
                A day before the arrival of the vessel, India gifted a Dornier 228 surveillance aircraft to Sri Lanka in a bid to bolster the island’s maritime surveillance capabilities.
                The Chinese ship was allowed into port on the condition it keeps its Automatic Identification System (AIS) switched on while in Sri Lankan waters and does not carry out scientific research.</p>
